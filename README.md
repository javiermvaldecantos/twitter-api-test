Simple web app to get your last tweets

__Check the web app [HERE](http://twitter-jmorenov.rhcloud.com/)!__

## How the app works
This app lets you get your last tweets just by entering your twitter username. It's a simple app I made to test Twitter API.

The site is fully responsive, so you can use it on your desktop PC and also on your mobile device.

## The technology
This app was built using Node.js and AngularJS (Angular 1). For the styling of the page I used a lot of Bootstrap an a bit of CSS.
